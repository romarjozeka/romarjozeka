# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm a Junior Software Developer, I have been away from software development for quite a bit due to mandatory military duties in Greece. Nevertheless, I've used my time since then and during the pandemic to build up my knowledge to pursue back-end development with modern Java.

### What's going on right now?
- I work in a pub in St James's park called Old Star (Come say hi :) ).
- I'm actively applying for Junior Java roles.
- Learning Spring Boot and refreshing algorithms.

### Recent GitHub projects
- A repository that i place the code of every algorithm i learn.
- (springboot-app-ws) A Spring Boot AWS application for learning purposes.
