# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm a Junior Software Developer, I have been away from software development for quite a bit due to mandatory military duties in Greece. Nevertheless, I've used my time since then and during the pandemic to build up my knowledge to pursue back-end development with modern Java.

### What's going on right now?
- Finished the AWS fundamentals course from AWS, did some Docker and filled some gaps on using Linux terminal.
- I'm actively applying for Junior Java roles.

### Recent GitHub projects
- (springboot-app-ws) A Spring Boot AWS application for learning purposes.
