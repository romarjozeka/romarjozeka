# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm a Junior Software Developer, I have been away from software development for quite a bit due to mandatory military duties. Nevertheless, I've used my time since then and during the pandemic to build up my knowledge to pursue back-end development with modern Java.

### What's going on right now?
- I'm actively looking for a Junior Java role in United Kingdom.
- Learning Spring Boot and refreshing algorithms.

### Recent GitHub projects
- A small Spring Boot CRUD app for learning purposes.
